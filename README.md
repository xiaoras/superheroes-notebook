# superheroes-notebook

This notebook contains the code used to train my superhero image classifier (find the internet app [here](https://superheroes.onrender.com)). The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab. The model is deployed on Render via [this repository](https://github.com/xiaoras/superheroes).
